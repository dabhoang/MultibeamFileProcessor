To run: clone repository, build using Visual Studio, then run executable. To run unit test, add command line argument of 'u' - for example,  "./Multibeam.exe u"
In appsettings.json, MaxFileSizeMB and AllowedExtensions are used for validation. MaxFileSizeMB for comparing checksum size and AllowedExtensions for checking extension of input file.
My approach listens for any files added to the Input folder. Once a new file is detected, it is checked to see if it's fully written. If fully written, the Checksum, Validation, and Compression steps are performed. If a step fails, it's moved to the Failed folder. Otherwise, the compressed .gz is placed in the Output folder and the original is moved to Archive.
